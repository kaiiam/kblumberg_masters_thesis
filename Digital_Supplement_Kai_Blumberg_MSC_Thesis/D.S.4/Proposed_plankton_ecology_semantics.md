# VoCamp Glacier Ontology Hackathon proposed terms

During the [VoCamp Glacier Ontology Hackathon](https://github.com/Vocamp/Virtual-Hackahon-on-Glacier-topic) there was discussion about how best to capture the semantics of an ablation process, given that there were partially different definitions given by the [NOAA National Weather Service (2009) glossary](http://w1.weather.gov/glossary/) and the [Cogley et al. (2011) IACS-UNESCO Glacier Mass Balance glossary](http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0019/001925/192525e.pdf).

To accommodate these definitional discrepancies  I propose the following as subclasses of ENVO:*ice ablation process* [ENVO_01000919]:

1) ENVO:*icemelt-derived ice ablation process*
defined as:
> An ice ablation process during which ice is lost due to an icemelt process.
