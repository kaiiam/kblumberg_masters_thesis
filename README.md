Title: Interconnecting Arctic observatory data through machine-actionable knowledge representation: are ontologies fit for purpose?

I am researching how the representation of expert knowledge about marine and polar environments, within an ontology, can help to interconnect polar observatory data. Leveraging FRAM and HAUSGARTEN projects such as microbial observatories and physical oceanography from ice moorings, I will attempt to demonstrate the feasibility of using an ontology to answer novel questions such as: "What changes in polar ecosystem services will result from decreasing sea ice coverage?".
