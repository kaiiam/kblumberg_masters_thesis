Can we use ontologies to find papers referencing data about a term? 

What are all the papers which reference any data set, which is about a part of a marine biome? 

#query for parts associated with a marine biome
./query_for_parts_associated_with_input_class.py http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00000447

#query for references to data sets which are about any part of a marine biome. 
./query_data_set_references.py parts_associated_with_ENVO_00000447.txt

#open and save data_set_assoc_raw.csv using a libreoffice or excel with delimiters being both commas and spaces to save it properly to inport into R. 

#clean data in R using data_set_references.R script.
